    "    2. \"Berlin_osm.py\" is able to generate and export all the relavant details in 5 csv files.\n",
    "    3. I adapted the code from \" street_name_imp.py\" to make \"node\" & \"way\" dictionaries.\n",
    "    4. The dictionaries are then written to the CSV files names appropriately. \n",
    "    5. I am unsure what to do further. There are all kinds of details in all the files\n",
